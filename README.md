The global pandemic of COVID-19 has an impact on health care and lifestyle around the world, and early detection is crucial for limiting case spread and mortality. The Reverse transcription Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most widely used diagnosis test; nevertheless, the time and expense of these tests are prohibitive, necessitating the use of additional quick and accessible diagnostic methods. This paper's technique is based on recent research that links the presence of COVID-19 to results in chest X-ray pictures. It processes these images and classifies them as positive or negative for COVID-19 using existing deep learning models (VGG19 and U-Net). The suggested system includes a preprocessing stage with lung segmentation, which removes the surrounds that do not provide significant information for the task and may cause biased findings; after this first stage, the proposed system moves on to the next stage, which is the analysis
